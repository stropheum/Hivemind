# Hivemind - A realistic bee colony simulation

Hivemind is a project I've started as an intersection of several interests of mine; AI programming, cellular automation, ecological simulations, and honey bees themselves. Since honey bees are such a crucial part of our ecosystem, and I hope to maintain a hive of my own in the near future, this project is a good opportunity to educate myself more about them while working on programming skills that interest me as well.
